> An immersive social media website that is focused on user interaction and community engagement.
>
> Vibe is a place for immersive social experiences, focusing on genuine connections and community engagement. It offers a space for users to escape life's hardships, relax, and connect through customizable 2D avatars. We believe in creating a vibrant digital ecosystem where every interaction is valued, celebrated, and cherished.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to create and customize my own 2D avatar on Vibe to reflect my personality and preferences. By personalizing my avatar's appearance and style, I can express myself creatively.
- As a user, I want to unwind and relax on Vibe, escaping from the stresses of daily life. Whether it's through casual chats with friends, participating in fun activities, or joining chat rooms.

### Premium User Stories

- As a Premium user, I want to have access to exclusive and advanced 2D avatar items so that I can stand out within the community.
- As a Premium user, I want to be first-in-line in customer support.

### Admin Stories

- As an admin, I want to oversee, moderate and manage the chatrooms on Vibe, to ensure that they remain active, engaging, and free from inappropriate content or behavior.
- As an admin, I want to manage users on Vibe, and ban them if they break the rules.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

### Vibe is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - 🚨 Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.

> We designed Vibe using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.
